# PianoViaR
A virtual reality piano environment

# About this project
PianoViaR features a virtual reality piano environment designed to aid piano students in their learning process while offering an affordable alternative to traditional piano setups. Developed for my final year project, this application incorporated LeapMotion, a hand tracking device that allowed users to interact with a virtual reality world using their hands in real-time.

The application includes a practice room with a fully functional 88-key piano and interactive exercises with an intuitive score that utilizes the LeapMotion SDK to help students practice key notations, musical chords, and musical notation in a fun and engaging way. Additionally, PianoViaR can read MIDI files and display them on the interactive score, giving students the ability to practice specific songs or arrangements.

Our development process was challenging as we had to learn extensively about Unity and 3D/VR techniques, but we were able to create an immersive and intuitive VR experience that was easy to use. Our application's success during the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly gratifying as it served as an alternative for students whose practice was interrupted by lockdowns. PianoViaR was highlighted as a means to enable students to continue their learning process in their homes, replicating the practice environment they were accustomed to.

Overall, I am proud of the result and thrilled to have contributed to the development of a useful and innovative technology application that has the potential to improve piano students' learning experiences.
